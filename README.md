## ðŸš© Challenge 0: Hello World - iOS/iPadOS

ðŸŽ« Deploy a simple HelloWorld contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The Flow CLI & local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Swift iOS/iPadOS app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

ðŸŒŸ The final deliverable is a Mobile DApp that lets users read and change a greeting field on Flow testnet. (ðŸ§¨ WalletConnect has not been configured so `DapperSC` and `Lilico` wallets will crash the application)
